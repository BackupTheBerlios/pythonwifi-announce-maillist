Subject: [Pythonwifi-announce] Python WiFi v0.5.0
Message-ID: <9ddeaee50912161631x184f2dbcqe9550b7c92394867@mail.gmail.com>

  I am pleased to announce that I finally got off my backside and uploaded
version 0.5.0 of Python WiFi.  This is currently only available on
http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7134 but I will
be uploading an egg to the Cheeseshop soon.
